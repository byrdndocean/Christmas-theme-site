# Christmas-theme-site
This was from a tutorial.  This featured pop ups as well as the implementation of Slider.js.  I'm currently remaking this website because I didn't like the mobile layout as well as the organization of the code.  I'll probably take some ideas from this like the pop ups and improve on the design for a holiday themed site.
